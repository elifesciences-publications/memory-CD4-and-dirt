The jupyter notebook contains codes used in fiiting proposed models to the observed data presented in the paper Hogan et al 2019, eLife (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48901). Please note that there is some issue with numbering the equations in the text which has to be sorted.

Data are in the file data_Elife_2019.xlsx.

Best fitted values of parameters for each model are in the file parameter_fits.xlsx.
Best fitted values of parameters for each source are in the file source_fits.xlsx.
